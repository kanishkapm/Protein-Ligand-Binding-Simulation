Protein-Ligand Interaction Visualization in MATLAB
Overview
This project demonstrates visualization of protein-ligand interactions using MATLAB. It includes:

A detailed 3D scatter plot of the protein-ligand complex (PDB ID: 5L2S)

A simplified 2D grid-based heatmap showing protein atom density with ligand overlay

Features
Parsing PDB files to extract atom coordinates

Distinguishing ligand atoms from protein atoms

3D scatter visualization of molecular structures

2D density heatmap to highlight protein spatial distribution

Usage
Download the PDB file (e.g., 5L2S) and save it in the project folder.

Run the MATLAB scripts to generate visualizations.

Explore plots for insight into binding sites and molecular structure.

Requirements
MATLAB (R2017 or later recommended)

PDB file of the protein-ligand complex

Future Work
Incorporate binding affinity calculations

Extend to interactive visualizations

Add automated ligand detection and analysis
